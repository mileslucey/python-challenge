# Python Challenge
## Summary
* A homework assignment for UC Berkeley's Data Analytics Bootcamp
* The PyBank and PyPoll folders contain separate analyses:
    * PyBank is a Python script that analyzes the financial records of a hypothetical company. The script calculates each of the following:
        * The total number of months included in the dataset
        * The total net amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
        * The average change in "Profit/Losses" between months over the entire period
        * The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
        * The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period
     * PyPoll is a Python script that analyzes polling data from a hypothetical town. The script calculates each of the following:
        * The total number of votes cast
        * A complete list of candidates who received votes
        * The percentage of votes each candidate won
        * The total number of votes each candidate won
        * The winner of the election based on popular vote
### Files
* Each of the two analyses includes the following:
   * A csv file with the data used in each analysis
   * A Python value that calculates the desired metrics from the csv
   * A text file that the Python code outputs
